## Key Metrics

- **Silhouette Score**: Measures how well-separated the clusters are, ranging from -1 to 1. Higher values indicate better-defined clusters. Here:
  - With 3 clusters, the silhouette score is highest (0.3074), indicating this model has relatively better-defined clusters than others.
  - As the number of clusters increases to 5, the score drops to 0.2858, suggesting less distinct clusters.

- **Calinski-Harabasz Score**: A measure of the dispersion of clusters, where higher values typically indicate well-separated clusters.
  - The highest score (617.5690) is observed with 3 clusters, which implies this configuration provides the most distinct separation.

- **Davies-Bouldin Index**: Measures average similarity between each cluster and the cluster most similar to it. Lower values indicate better-defined clusters.
  - The lowest Davies-Bouldin index (0.9716) is observed with 5 clusters, suggesting improved cluster definition compared to other cluster counts.

## Conclusion

From the clustering performance metrics:

- **Best Configuration**: The clustering with 3 clusters provides the best balance, given the higher silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz scores.
- **Alternative Configurations**: Clustering with 5 clusters has the lowest Davies-Bouldin index, suggesting slightly better-defined clusters. However, its lower silhouette score indicates less distinct separation among clusters.

Overall, the **3-cluster model** is likely the optimal choice based on silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz scores, which reflect better-separated and more cohesive clusters. The **5-cluster model** can be considered if finer distinctions between clusters are desired, but with a trade-off in terms of cluster separation quality.
