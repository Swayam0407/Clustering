# Clustering Evaluation

To evaluate the clustering results for the configurations ranging from k=3 to k=6, we analyze several metrics that provide insights into the quality of the clusters formed.

## Metrics Overview

### 1. Silhouette Score
The silhouette score measures how well-separated the clusters are and how similar data points within each cluster are. A score closer to 1 indicates better-defined clusters, while scores near 0 or negative suggest overlapping clusters.

- **Interpretation**: 
  - For k=3 to k=6, the silhouette scores range between **0.3153** and **0.3345**. 
  - These relatively low scores suggest that the clusters are not well-separated and may overlap.
  - The highest silhouette score (**0.3345**) occurs at k=4, indicating that k=4 may be a better choice for separation quality compared to other configurations.

### 2. Calinski-Harabasz Index
Also known as the variance ratio criterion, this index measures the ratio of the sum of between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion. Higher values indicate better-defined clusters.

- **Interpretation**:
  - The Calinski-Harabasz index is highest at **k=6 (650.9669)**, suggesting that k=6 has slightly better-defined clusters in terms of variance.
  - However, the differences in values across k=3 to k=6 are small, implying that adding more clusters doesn't significantly improve separation.

### 3. Davies-Bouldin Index
This index assesses the average similarity ratio of each cluster with its most similar cluster, where lower values indicate better clustering (i.e., well-separated and compact clusters).

- **Interpretation**:
  - The Davies-Bouldin index decreases as k increases, reaching its lowest value (**0.9500**) at k=6. 
  - This suggests that k=6 has the most compact clusters, though the values do not vary significantly between the different cluster options.

### 4. Homogeneity, Completeness, and Rand Index
These metrics are not applicable in this context since all values are **0**, indicating either the evaluations are not relevant or there are no ground-truth labels available for comparison. These metrics are more meaningful in supervised settings where true labels exist.

## Conclusion

Based on the evaluation metrics:
- **k=4** emerges as the optimal choice, yielding the highest silhouette score and suggesting moderately well-separated clusters. 
- Although the Calinski-Harabasz and Davies-Bouldin indices slightly favor k=6, the small differences indicate that increasing the number of clusters beyond k=4 may not provide significant benefits.

### Evaluation Summary
- For practical purposes, **k=4** offers a balanced choice, achieving better separation without complicating the cluster structure unnecessarily.
- If a more compact cluster structure is desired, experimenting with **k=6** may be worthwhile, though the improvement is minimal.
  
In general, k=4 is recommended for a simpler model with moderately well-separated clusters, while k=6 could be explored for slightly more compact clusters at the expense of interpretability.
