# Clustering Analysis

## Overview
This project explores various clustering algorithms, specifically K-Means and Hierarchical clustering, to analyze and derive insights from datasets. The aim is to understand the effectiveness of these algorithms in grouping data points based on their characteristics.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

1. **model_building/**  
   - `Building_the_model.ipynb`
  
2. **kMeansModel/**  
   - `kMeans.ipynb`  
   - `PRE-REQUISITES.md`  
   - `RESULT.md`  
   - `CONCLUSION.md`  

3. **HierarchialModel/**  
   - `Hierarchial.ipynb`  
   - `PRE-REQUISITES.md`  
   - `RESULT.md`  
   - `CONCLUSION.md`  

4. **General Files:**  
   - `PRE-REQUISITES.md`  
   - `RESULT.md`  
   - `CONCLUSION.md`  

## Usage
